# Java samples for Azure AI Search

This repository contains Java code samples used in Azure AI Search documentation. Unless noted otherwise, all samples run on the shared (free) pricing tier of an [Azure AI Search service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal).  

+ Use the **main** branch for code samples that call the [Azure AI Search client library for Java](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/search-documents-readme).

+ Use the [**java-rest-api**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-java-samples/tree/java-rest-api)  branch for older code samples that call the AI Search REST APIs.

| Sample | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [quickstart](./quickstart/README.md) | "Day One" introduction to the fundamental tasks of working with a search index: create, load, and query. This Java console app uses a subset of the hotels demo data set, using just 4 documents as a test case. This sample is built on the [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/install) using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build system. This sample has a dependency on the [com.azure:azure-search-documents](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-search-documents) package.|
| [rag-quickstart](./rag-quickstart/README.md) | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern using Azure AI Search for retrieval and Azure OpenAI for generation. This Java console app demonstrates how to create a vector search index, generate embeddings, and use retrieved documents to generate natural language responses. Requires Azure OpenAI Service with embedding and chat completion models. This sample is built on the [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/install) using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build system. This sample has dependencies on the [com.azure:azure-search-documents](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-search-documents) package and Azure OpenAI SDK.|
| [vector-quickstart](./vector-quickstart/README.md) | Vector search capabilities using Azure AI Search with HNSW algorithm. This Java console app demonstrates how to create an index with vector field configurations, load documents with pre-computed embeddings, and execute vector similarity searches and hybrid queries. Requires Azure AI Search Basic tier or higher. This sample is built on the [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/install) using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build system. This sample has a dependency on the [com.azure:azure-search-documents](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-search-documents) package.|
| [semantic-ranking-quickstart](./semantic-ranking-quickstart/README.md) | Semantic ranking capabilities to improve search relevance using Azure AI Search. This Java console app demonstrates how to create an index with semantic configuration, load documents, and execute queries with semantic ranking to get improved relevance scoring and semantic captions. Requires Azure AI Search Standard tier or higher with semantic ranking enabled. This sample is built on the [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/install) using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build system. This sample has a dependency on the [com.azure:azure-search-documents](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-search-documents) package.|
