# Azure Cognitive Search Java Samples repository

This repository contains Java code samples for Azure Cognitive Search. The **java-rest-apis** branch contains Java code samples that call the Cognitive Search REST APIs. The **master** branch contains samples that use the [Azure Cognitive Search client library for Java](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/search-documents-readme).

Java samples in the **master** branch use the [com.azure:azure-search-documents](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-search-documents) package. 

Review the [package readme](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/search-documents-readme) for an overview and links to [source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/azure-search-documents_11.1.2/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/src), [API reference](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-java/), and [API samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents).

The following code samples were built on [Java 11](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/) using the [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/) build system.
