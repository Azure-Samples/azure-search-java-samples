# Quickstart: Semantic ranking in Azure AI Search using Java

![Flask sample MIT license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

Semantic ranking capabilities to improve search relevance using Azure AI Search. This Java sample demonstrates how to create an index with a semantic configuration, upload documents to the index, and execute queries with semantic ranking to get improved relevance scoring and semantic captions. Requires a search service on the Standard pricing tier or higher with semantic ranking enabled.

This sample is built on the [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/install) using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build system. This sample has dependencies on the [Azure AI Search](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-search-documents) and [Azure Identity](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-identity) client libraries.

To run this sample, follow the step-by-step instructions in [Quickstart: Semantic ranking](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-semantic?pivots=java).
